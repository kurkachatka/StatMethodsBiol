This repository containes code in R that generates data used during statistic course taught at Biology Faculty of University of Gdansk for master students.

During this course students are taught basic methods, most of them are parametric statisitcal analaysis, therefore a lot of normaly distributed data with even variance and no autocorrelation is needed.
As such data is rare 'in the wild', I have decided to generate it for this teaching assigment:
1) ANOVA with repeated measurements
2) multifactor ANOVA
3) correlation and regression (linear models)
4) Chi2 test
