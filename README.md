This repository contains code in R that generates data used during statistics courses taught at the University of Gdansk Biology Faculty for master students.

During this course students are taught basic methods, most of which are parametric statistical analyses, therefore a lot of normally distributed data with even variance, and no autocorrelation is needed.
As such data is rare 'in the wild', I have decided to generate it for this teaching assignment. List of analyses performed with those datasets:
1) ANOVA with repeated measurements
2) multifactor ANOVA
3) correlation and regression (linear models)
4) Chi2 test
